%% JBFILL - Fills a region with a color between provided two vectors (Bockstege 2006)
%
% USAGE: [fillhandle,msg]=jbfill(xpoints,upper,lower,color,edge,add,transparency)
% This function will fill a region with a color between the two vectors provided
% using the Matlab fill command.
%
% fillhandle is the returned handle to the filled region in the plot.
% xpoints= The horizontal data points (ie frequencies). Note length(Upper)
%         must equal Length(lower)and must equal length(xpoints)!
% upper = the upper curve values (data can be less than lower)
% lower = the lower curve values (data can be more than upper)
% color = the color of the filled area 
% edge  = the color around the edge of the filled area
% add   = a flag to add to the current plot or make a new one.
% transparency is a value ranging from 1 for opaque to 0 for invisible for
% the filled color only.

% Example:
%     a=rand(1,20);%Vector of random data
%     b=a+2*rand(1,20);%2nd vector of data points;
%     x=1:20;%horizontal vector
%     [ph,msg]=jbfill(x,a,b,rand(1,3),rand(1,3),0,rand(1,1))
%     grid on
%     legend('Datr')
